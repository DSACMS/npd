# ETLs
The `etls/` directory contains pipelines that extract, transform, and load (ETL) ancillary data into the database for the FHIR API. Each sub-directory in the `etls/` directory represents a different input data source. Note: these are helper ETLs, specific to the FHIR API. The main ETLs are found in the [Puffin Repo](https://github.com/DSACMS/npd_Puffin). Eventually this folder will store code to map the data from the core data product data model to the provider directory data model.
