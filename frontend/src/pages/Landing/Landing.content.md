## About the National Provider Directory

### Initial testing release: Building the foundation together

For years, provider directories have been fragmented, inconsistent, and burdensome for everyone who depends on them. Providers spend valuable time maintaining the same information across dozens of systems. Payers struggle to confirm details. Patients often cannot find accurate information about where to receive care.

The National Provider Directory (NPD) aims to fix that by creating a single, trusted source for provider and payer information across the U.S. healthcare system. The directory is being developed as a shared public resource, maintained collectively by CMS, providers, health plans, and other partners to ensure data stays accurate and up to date.

This early release introduces the first version of this modern platform, focused on core building blocks:

* Accurate provider and organizational hierarchies  
* Practice and facility addresses  
* Licensing and credentialing information  
* Interoperability details at each location, such as FHIR endpoints

This information is currently only using CMS data sources and is in the early testing feedback phase. Early users will help CMS validate and improve these foundational elements. Feedback from this testing phase will directly inform the next development cycles, ensuring the directory meets the real-world needs of patients, providers, and payers.

The next phases will add external data, connectivity details, and participation of CMS-Aligned Networks (health data networks that are voluntarily meeting the [CMS Interoperability Framework](https://www.cms.gov/health-technology-ecosystem/interoperability-framework) criteria).

### Long-term vision: A shared source of truth for healthcare

The long-term goal is to create a national, authoritative provider directory that reduces administrative burden, increases data accuracy, and improves patient access to care.

By consolidating the fragmented systems that exist today, the NPD will allow updates made by providers or health plans in one place to flow across the ecosystem. This shared responsibility model will reduce redundant reporting, eliminate confusion, and create cost savings for both the public and private sectors.

Future releases will expand beyond the initial scope to include:

* Verification of provider identity and standing through CMS-managed identity proofing  
* APIs that allow systems to confirm provider status in real time  
* Integration of health plan participation data  
* Incorporation of external data sources to enhance accuracy and completeness  
* User pathways to report new or corrected information, enabling shared accountability for data quality  
* Continued collaboration with states, networks, and private organizations to ensure comprehensive coverage  
* Richer interoperability data, including FHIR endpoints and participation in CMS-Aligned Networks

An accurate, connected directory is essential infrastructure for modern healthcare. It supports interoperability, enables trusted data exchange, and strengthens care coordination nationwide. The National Provider Directory will serve as the digital map of U.S. healthcare, linking the people, organizations, and systems that deliver care every day.
