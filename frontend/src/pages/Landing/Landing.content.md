## Long-term vision

CMS is creating a modern directory that will serve as the definitive source for provider and payer information across the U.S. healthcare system. Health plans and providers will maintain this shared resource to benefit patients, providers, and the entire healthcare community.

This comprehensive directory will transform how our national healthcare system operates by reducing administrative burden on payers and providers while delivering more accurate, timely data to those who need it most. The National Provider Directory will serve as a digital map for healthcare, so systems can talk to each other in real time and patients can receive connected care.

The directory will provide critical information that supports coordinated, high-quality patient care across all healthcare settings. It will have essential, up-to-date information including practitioner details, practice addresses, and hospital affiliations. Most importantly, it will feature current interoperability addresses, data sharing network connections, and individual endpoint information to enable seamless healthcare data exchange.
