This is an early release of the National Provider Directory that combines data from multiple CMS data sources to create a new dataset of healthcare providers, accessible through a FHIR API.

CMS is building the directory in the open by collaborating with early adopters of the [CMS Digital Health Ecosystem](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/health-technology-ecosystem/overview).
