The NPD front end consists of React + TypeScript built by vite.dev, deployed as static assets and developed as part of the NPD `backend/` Django application.

## System description

### User interface

User Interface designs can be found [in Figma, here](https://www.figma.com/design/YsHkTGfeb8kSm1jCfPAJ0h/National-Provider-Directory-MVP).

To the extent possible, we will use components provided by the [CMS Design System](https://design.cms.gov/?theme=core) or the [US Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) when building the front end.

### Data

The front end fetches data from the NPD FHIR API.

If we find this approach to be insufficient, we will assess additional API endpoints.

## Project structure

- The `src` directory contains all front end code
  - `assets/` contains static assets
  - `components/` contains custom components
  - `hooks/` contains custom hook implementations
  - `pages/` top level page components
  - `i18n/en/` contains translation / static content definition files

### Static content

Any static content which appears on a page as part of a React HTML or other component tag should be stored in the appropriate `src/i18/**/*.json` source file and accessed via the [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) `t()` function. This allows us to isolate content from behavior and will allow for easier translation in the future, should the need arise.

We recommend using the `useTranslation` hook to access the `t()` function. For example:

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  return (
    <div className="ds-u-display--flex">
      <p>{t("component.disclaimer")}</p>
      <p><a href="#">{t("component.link")}</a></p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

For larger or full-page content, we're using Markdown files, conventionally named `*.content.md`, loaded with the `?raw` query supported by vite.

```tsx
import Markdown from 'react-markdown'

import content from './MyPage.content.md?raw'

const MyPage = () => {

  return (
    <div className="usa-prose">
      <Markdown>{ content }</Markdown>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And `MyPage.content.md`:

````markdown
## This is a page

It has text in headings and paragraphs.

You can use `inline code` or write in blocks:

```py
import code
code.blocks()
```

[Links work](#data) just like in markdown.

## Local development

### Prerequesites

- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) or other suitable container runner
- a running instance of the npd backend: `docker compose up django-web`

### Running the frontend app

There are two options for running the frontend application in development. Each has a time and a place

#### Option 1: build assets for the backend

At present, NPD deployment involves compiling the frontend assets into the `backend/provider_directory/static` directory and then building an image with the resulting static assets present.

You can simulate this setup by using the `npm run watch` command to build frontend assets and serve them from the backend application.

From the `npd` project root:

0. Start the backend with `docker compose up -d django-web`
1. Run the frontend server in build + watch mode:
    - in docker with: `docker compose up web`
    - on host with: `cd frontend; npm run watch`
2. Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser

**Limitations:**

- rebuilds the entire frontend app on changes, takes around 3 seconds
- requires manual page reload when assests are rebuilt (no hot reload)
- assets are deleted when the backend test suite runs
- trickier to trace from compiled assets back to original components

**Benefits:**

- matches the deploy project setup
- plain HTML form POST works as expected
- one set of URLs (localhost:8000) for search app and API work

#### Option 2: vite dev server

From the `npd` project root:

1. Run the frontend vite dev server
    - in docker with: `bin/npr --publish 3000:3000 npm run dev`
    - on host with: `cd frontend; npm run dev`
3. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser

**Limitations:**

- requires CORS and CSRF workarounds for API requests and `<form action="..." method="POST">` posting across domains (`localhost:3000` in the browser sending to the server at `localhost:8000`)

**Benefits**:

- nearly instantaneous reloading of changed components and styles


## Adding dependencies

tl;dr - Because of our current frontend docker compose setup, new dependencies **MUST** be installed with `docker compose run web npm install`. They will not be picked up by `docker compose build web` or `docker compose up --build web`.

In the interest of not creating large, orphaned docker volumes whenever frontend dependencies updated, we are using a virtual docker compose volume in place of the frontend service image's `/app/node_modules` directory.

Unfortunately, `docker compose build` doesn't recognize _runtime_ virtual volume mounts, only _host_ and _base image_ mounts described by the `frontend/Dockerfile`. This means rerunning `docker compose build web` after `package.json` updates will only update base image `/app/node_modules` directory, not the `docker compose up web` virtual `node_modules:/app/node_modules` virtual volume.

Thus, if you are running in docker containers with `docker compose` and want to add a frontend dependency, you'll need to make sure they are added to the docker compose `node_modules` virtual volume mount, which is what running `docker compose run npm install` does. This is similar to keeping your host environment up to date, which requires re-running `npm install` after pulling changes to `frontend/package.json`.

### Example dependency addition

```sh
# install and save a new dependency on host, to make the editor tooling happy
cd frontend
npm install --save i18next

# in docker, to make the image happy
docker compose run --rm web npm install
```

Likewise, if `package.json` has been updated since you last fetched project updates, you'll need to run:

```sh
# after `git pull` when frontend/package.json has been updated
docker compse run --rm web npm install
```

to refresh your local frontend docker compose `web` service.
